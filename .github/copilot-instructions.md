# Copilot Instructions (GitHub context)

## Purpose

Guide GitHub Copilot and Copilot Chat to help with ALM tasks, documentation, and code reviews.

## Focus Areas

- Read unpacked source in src/.
- Propose root-level CHANGELOG.md entries.
- Suggest semantic version tags and Release notes.
- Assist with pac commands for export/unpack/pack.
- Keep root clean; prefer src/config, src/tools, src/tests (exception: CHANGELOG.md, README.md).
