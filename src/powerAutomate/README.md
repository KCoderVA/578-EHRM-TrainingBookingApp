# Power Automate

This folder contains unpacked and packaged Power Automate flows used by the EHRM Training Scheduler App.

## v0.0.1 contents
- `AppUserList/` — flow template that populates user demographics in the access-control SharePoint list.

## Note on environment-specific values
Unpacked flow definitions can contain environment-specific identifiers and internal URLs (tenant IDs, SharePoint site URLs, app play URLs, email addresses). Review/sanitize before publishing broadly if needed.
