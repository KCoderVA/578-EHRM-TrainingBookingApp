## Sample Data Credit
- Sanitized sample CSV exports for the connected SharePoint lists (Desk Reservations, DeskAccessControl, Desks) were provided by Hiram A. Zayas to support local development and testing.

- The initial `AppUserList` flow template was authored by **Kyle Coder** (Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital, VISN12) and imported as the baseline automation for v0.0.1.

## Baseline Details
- Version: v0.0.1
- Baseline date: December 31, 2025
- App: EHRM Training & Booking App (Edward Hines Jr. VA Hospital, VISN12)
