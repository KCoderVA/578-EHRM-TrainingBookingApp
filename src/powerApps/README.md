# Power Apps (Canvas)

This folder contains unpacked and packaged Canvas Power Apps used by the EHRM Training & Booking App.

## Versioned structure
Canvas app artifacts are stored in versioned subfolders:
- `src/powerApps/v0.0.2/`
  - `.zip/` — export artifacts from the web editor (kept local; zip files are ignored by `.gitignore`)
  - `.msapp/` — the raw `.msapp` package
  - `.unpacked/` — unpacked source generated by Power Platform CLI
  - `README.md` — per-version notes, screens, and provenance

## Common workflow
Use the VS Code tasks in this repo (recommended):
- Canvas: Unpack .msapp to src
- Canvas: Pack src to .msapp

Or run CLI directly:
- `pac canvas unpack --msapp "<path-to-msapp>" --source "<path-to-unpacked>" --force`
- `pac canvas pack --msapp "<path-to-msapp>" --sources "<path-to-unpacked>"`

## Notes
- Unpacked Canvas sources can contain environment-specific identifiers and URLs. Review/sanitize before broad publication.
